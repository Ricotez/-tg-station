//This is the second part to organdata, but not as important as the organ datums.
//An organsystem is really just a convenient way to define different structures of organs, so you don't have to define them in every mob's constructor individually.
//Creating an organsystem is easy, just look at the examples.
//By the way, remember that these are just the datums, the "reservations" of organ spaces.
//You'll still need to fill them up with actual physical organs in the mob constructor.

//Also, please remember that this system is OPTIONAL. If you don't give a mob an organsystem, it will use the old system with list/organs and list/internal_organs.
