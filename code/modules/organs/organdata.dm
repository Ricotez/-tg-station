//IMPORTANT: Think of organdata as a "reservation" for organ spaces in a mob.
//It gives a container type that can stay constant while the actual organ itself changes.
//This system is based on Bay's, so thanks to whichever coder originally designed it.
//But unlike Bay's system, we store most of the organ-related data in physical organs. These datums really are nothing more than "reservations".

//ALSO IMPORTANT: If you want to actually do anything with an organ, check if it exists with exists() first,
//then access the organitem to perform the operations on. Organdata should not actually store most organ-related data.

//is no longer a part of your body. |- Ricotez
